Statement

There is a very beutiful girl named Jasmine in the college and Manan is trying on her for a very long time. One fine day, he gets her attention. Jasmine plays a game with Manan.
In a game she gives Manan 5 triplets initially and after that for the 6th time just the first two numbers of the triplet. Manan is supposed to guess the third number of the triplet correctly by observing the pattern in the first 5 triplets.
Manan is really smart but in front of her crush he is getting very nervous. As a good friend of him you want to help your friend by correctly guessing the third number.

Initial triplets given by her are :

<1 , 10 , 4>     
<4 , 17 , 5>     
<10 , 23 , 5>     
<131 , 199 , 15>     
<1000000 , 10000000 , 586081>     

Assume that she gives first two numbers L, R for the first query
1 <= L <= R <= 10^8
